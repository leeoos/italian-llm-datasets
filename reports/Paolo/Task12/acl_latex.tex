\section{The description of the dataset}

The dataset comprises two tasks aimed at detecting hate speech. Task 1 focuses on Hate Speech Detection, 
where the goal is to classify whether a message contains hate speech or not. The training set consists of 5,600 tweets 
from PolicyCorpusXL, while the test set includes 1,400 tweets from PolicyCorpusXL and 3,000 tweets from ReligiousHate. 
In Task 2, termed Contextual Hate Speech Detection, both the content of tweets and their metadata are considered 
for classification. This task includes two sub-tasks: Political Hate Speech Detection, which utilizes data from both 
development and test sets from PolicyCorpusXL, and Religious Hate Speech Detection, where only the test data 
from ReligiousHate is provided, adapted from an original cross-domain task.


\section{Methodology to reframe the dataset}

I exploited the fact that each row of data ends with the name of the dataset and used that to separate each line. 
In the test set the data is taken from two datasets so the name changes accordingly but i still used the same approch 
by first dividing for political\_test and then I iterated in each line to divide it again by Religious\_test and put it all 
in a list. I then iterated over the resulting list and created a dictionary where the keys are the id of the tweet and 
the values are themselfs a dictionary with as key the type of data (Ex. "text", "label", "created at") and the values is 
the data. I differentiate between test and training and textual data and conte data from the filepath string.

\section{Prompts}

I created 4 prompts for each task, and i added in task 2 the following metadata, created at and user\_created\_at beacause the 
age of the profile at the time of writing might have a correlation with the task. For the same reason I added status, friend
e followers count.

\section{How to run}
To run the parser you should download all the required libraries (Gitpython zipfie and pandas) set the folder contating 
task\_12.py as CWD and then run
\begin{quote}
  \begin{verbatim}
    python task_27.py
  \end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
\noindent You will need to download the dataset manually, but .
