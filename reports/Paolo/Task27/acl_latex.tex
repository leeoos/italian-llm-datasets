\section{The description of the dataset}

The dataset comprises two tasks aimed at detecting hate speech. Task 1 focuses on Hate Speech Detection, 
where the goal is to classify whether a message contains hate speech or not. The training set consists of 5,600 tweets 
from PolicyCorpusXL, while the test set includes 1,400 tweets from PolicyCorpusXL and 3,000 tweets from ReligiousHate. 
In Task 2, termed Contextual Hate Speech Detection, both the content of tweets and their metadata are considered 
for classification. This task includes two sub-tasks: Political Hate Speech Detection, which utilizes data from both 
development and test sets from PolicyCorpusXL, and Religious Hate Speech Detection, where only the test data 
from ReligiousHate is provided, adapted from an original cross-domain task.

\section{Methodology to reframe the dataset}

I exploited the fact that the data was formatted with <user... to signal the line where there was informations 
about the user I used this regularity to find the topic with a regualar expression and <post>, </post> to divide 
each post and </user> to indicate when the posts from a single user end. \\
I put in a dictionary the posts as values and the topics as keys and if the topics where not divisible by 5 I would 
add empty strings to fill missing samples 

\section{Methodology and rationale behind the distractors}

I randomly selected the distractors and made sure that they are not the same between each other and with the true topic. 
I then shuffled the list of distractors to prevent the creation of a pattern in the indexes of the choice list.

\section{Prompts}

We created 6 prompts of 2 kinds 3 in free generation style and 3 where the answers were constrained by a list of provided 
choices.

\section{How to run}
To run the parser you should set the folder contating task\_27.py as CWD and then run
\begin{quote}
  \begin{verbatim}
    python task_27.py
  \end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
\noindent You will also need to download the dataset manually from this github https://github.com/mirkolai/EVALITA2023-HaSpeeDe3
in the same directory as the .py file
