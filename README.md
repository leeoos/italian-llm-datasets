# Introduction
Evaluation dataset creation for Generative Language Models, start from existing evaluation datasets and convert them into a format useful to evaluate the linguistic skills of Large Language Models (LLMs)

There are several possible tasks:
- Word or sentence level tasks
- Binary or multi-categorization tasks
- Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks
